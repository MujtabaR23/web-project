                Mercedes-Benz, a brand of the Mercedes-Benz Group, has been involved in Formula One as both team owner
                and engine manufacturer for various periods since 1954. The Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team, which is
                based in Brackley, England,[1] and possesses a German licence,[2] is as of 2022 majority owned by the
                Mercedes-Benz Group with Toto Wolff having a significant shareholding. Mercedes-branded teams are often
                referred to by the nickname, the "Silver Arrows". An announcement was made in December 2020[3] that
                Ineos planned to take a one third equal ownership stake alongside the Mercedes-Benz Group and Wolff;
                this came into effect on 25 January 2022.[4]

                Before the Second World War, Mercedes-Benz competed in the European Championship, winning three titles.
                The marque debuted in Formula One in 1954. After winning their first race at the 1954 French Grand Prix,
                driver Juan Manuel Fangio won another three Grands Prix to win the 1954 Drivers' Championship and
                repeated this success in 1955. Despite winning two Drivers' Championships, Mercedes-Benz withdrew from
                motor racing after 1955 in response to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.

                Mercedes returned to Formula One in 1994 as an engine manufacturer in association with Ilmor, a British
                independent high-performance autosport engineering company, which developed their engines. The company
                won one constructors' title and three drivers' titles in a works partnership with McLaren which lasted
                until 2009. In 2005, Ilmor was rebranded as Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains. In 2010, the
                company bought the Brawn GP team, rebranding it as Mercedes. Since a major rule shake-up in 2014, which
                required the use of turbochargers and hybrid electric engines, Mercedes has become one of the most
                successful teams in Formula One history, winning seven consecutive Drivers' titles from 2014 to 2020 and
                eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021. It has set records for most wins in a season
                (19 in 2016), and for most consecutive constructors' titles. The manufacturer has also collected more
                than 200 wins as an engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One history. Ten Constructors' and
                thirteen Drivers' Championships have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.
