                Mercedes-Benz, a brand of the Mercedes-Benz Group, has been involved in Formula One as both team owner
                and engine manufacturer for various periods since 1954. The Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team, which is
                based in Brackley, England,[1] and possesses a German licence,[2] is as of 2022 majority owned by the
                Mercedes-Benz Group with Toto Wolff having a significant shareholding. Mercedes-branded teams are often
                referred to by the nickname, the "Silver Arrows". An announcement was made in December 2020[3] that
                Ineos planned to take a one third equal ownership stake alongside the Mercedes-Benz Group and Wolff;
                this came into effect on 25 January 2022.

                Mercedes returned to Formula One in 1994 as an engine manufacturer in association with Ilmor, a British
                independent high-performance autosport engineering company, which developed their engines. The company
                won one constructors' title and three drivers' titles in a works partnership with McLaren which lasted
                until 2009. In 2005, Ilmor was rebranded as Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains. In 2010, the
                company bought the Brawn GP team, rebranding it as Mercedes. Since a major rule shake-up in 2014, which
                required the use of turbochargers and hybrid electric engines, Mercedes has become one of the most
                successful teams in Formula One history, winning seven consecutive Drivers' titles from 2014 to 2020 and
                eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021. It has set records for most wins in a season
                (19 in 2016), and for most consecutive constructors' titles. The manufacturer has also collected more
                than 200 wins as an engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One history. Ten Constructors' and
                thirteen Drivers' Championships have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.

            <h3> Lewis Hamilton </h3>
            <p>
                Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE HonFREng (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver. He
                currently competes in Formula One for Mercedes, having previously driven for McLaren from 2007 to 2012.
                In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with
                Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (103), and podium
                finishes (183), among others.

                Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren young driver programme in 1998.
                This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren in 2007, making Hamilton the first, and so far only, black
                driver to race in the series. That season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to
                Kimi Räikkönen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a
                crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest Formula One
                World Champion in history. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.

            <h3> George Russell </h3>
            <p>
                George William Russell (born 15 February 1998) is a British racing driver currently competing
                in Formula One for Mercedes.[2] He was the 2018 FIA Formula 2 Champion for ART and the 2017 GP3 Series
                Champion. Following his Formula 2 championship win, Russell signed for Williams in 2019, making his
                debut at the 2019 Australian Grand Prix, although he stood in for Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes at the 2020
                Sakhir Grand Prix. Russell achieved his first F1 podium with Williams at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix. He
                is also part of the Mercedes Young Driver programme.[3]
