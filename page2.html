                Red Bull Racing, also simply known as Red Bull or RBR and competing as Oracle Red Bull Racing, is a
                Formula One racing team, racing a Honda-built Red Bull powered car under an Austrian licence and based
                in the United Kingdom. It is one of two Formula One teams owned by beverage company Red Bull GmbH, the
                other being Scuderia AlphaTauri (previously Scuderia Toro Rosso). The Red Bull Racing team has been
                managed by Christian Horner since its formation in 2005.[6]

                Red Bull had Cosworth engines in 2005 and Ferrari engines in 2006. The team used engines supplied by
                Renault between 2007 and 2018 (from 2016 to 2018, the Renault engine was re-badged "TAG Heuer" following
                the breakdown in the relationship between Red Bull and Renault in 2015).[7][8] During this partnership,
                they won four successive Drivers' and Constructors' Championship titles from 2010 to 2013, becoming the
                first Austrian team to win the title.[9] The team began using Honda engines in 2019.[10] The works Honda
                partnership culminated in 2021 following Red Bull driver Max Verstappen's World Drivers' Championship
                victory. Honda will continue to supply complete engines from Japan to Red Bull and AlphaTauri until the
                end of 2025.[11]
