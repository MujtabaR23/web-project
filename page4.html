                Scuderia Ferrari S.p.A. (Italian: [skudeˈriːa ferˈraːri]) is the racing division of luxury Italian auto
                manufacturer Ferrari and the racing team that competes in Formula One racing. The team is also nicknamed
                "The Prancing Horse", in reference to their logo. It is the oldest surviving and most successful Formula
                One team, having competed in every world championship since the 1950 Formula One season.[6] The team was
                founded by Enzo Ferrari, initially to race cars produced by Alfa Romeo, though by 1947 Ferrari had begun
                building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside Formula One are winning the World
                Sportscar Championship, 24 Hours of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Spa, 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring,
                Bathurst 12 Hour, races for Grand tourer cars and racing on road courses of the Targa Florio, the Mille
                Miglia and the Carrera Panamericana. The team is also known for its passionate support base, known as
                the tifosi. The Italian Grand Prix at Monza is regarded as the team's home race.

            <h3> Charles Leclerc </h3>
            <p>
                Charles Marc Hervé Perceval Leclerc[3] (French pronunciation: ​[ʃaʁl ləklɛʁ]; born 16 October 1997) is a
                Monégasque racing driver, currently racing in Formula One for Scuderia Ferrari. Leclerc won the GP3
                Series championship in 2016 and the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017.

                Leclerc made his Formula One debut in 2018 for Sauber, a team affiliated with Ferrari, for which he was
                part of the Ferrari Driver Academy. With Sauber having finished last the year before, Leclerc led the
                charge to improve its finishing position in the constructors' championship to eighth, and was the higher
                ranked of the two Sauber drivers.

                Starting in 2019 and contracted until the end of the 2024 season, Leclerc drives for Ferrari. He became
                the second-youngest driver to qualify on pole position in Formula One at the 2019 Bahrain Grand Prix.
                The 2019 season also saw Leclerc take his first career win in Belgium. He won the Pole Trophy in the
                2019 season, becoming the youngest driver to win it.

            <p>
                Carlos Sainz Vázquez de Castro (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkaɾlos ˈsajnθ ˈβaθkeθ ðe ˈkastɾo] (audio

                Sainz[a], is a Spanish racing driver competing in Formula One for Scuderia Ferrari. He is the son of
                Carlos Sainz, a double World Rally Champion, and the nephew of rally driver Antonio Sainz.[3][4][5][6]

                In 2012, Sainz raced in the British and European Formula 3 championships for Carlin.[7] He raced for
                DAMS in the 2014 Formula Renault 3.5 season, winning the championship before moving to F1 with Toro
